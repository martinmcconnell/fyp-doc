# Abstract

# Introduction

## Purpose, Intended Use and Audience
The purpose of this project is to create a system for the publication of scientific articles which
can be reviewed publicly where every reviewer is in possession of a digital signature for verification.
The digital signature will be provided utilising the Metamask wallet browser extension and app, In order
to log in to the web app and to verify identity to be able to review a wallet must be used, this wallet
will cryptographically secure each users contributions and will allow for a token to be created as a
rewards system for all contributions, review, publication.
The contents of the website are distributed between all members of via IPFS a decentralised system, this
is where the website will be hosted/distributed.

There is an increased distrust in scientific research in many fields of study and the main purpose of
this system is to remove the corportate structure of the current journal publication where in many cases
corporations have been found to create and promote articles with bias towards certain priorities that
suit the business opportunities of the corporation and not the actual scientific consensus. This feature
should help restore and build trust.

## Goals and Requirements


### Goals
To build a successful prototype and articulate the justification for this project to a universal
understanding as to why this needs to exist.

# Methodology

## Exploratory Analysis

### Mind Map

The first half of this section is research and an exploration of tech,
leading to the developmental approach to be taken i.e. Agile, TDD etc.

## Decentralised
According to **(IPFS, 2022)** Decentralisation is the downloading of a file or files from many locations
that are not managed by a single organisation. The fundamental ethos behind decentralisation is the
creation of a resilient internet where if a service is under attack through a denial of service or
ransomware attack the service could be disrupted, the modern internet relies on services like Amazon Web
Services(AWS) to perform quick rerouting and load-balancing in such eventualities but again this is
reliant on a single entity.

This property of having caches of content distributed globally allows for a protocol where the content
can be addressed from anywhere including remotely with little to no internet access and from a location
geographically closer to the device retrieving said content.

There have been many protocols proposed to achieve these fundamental goals.

## Comparing technologies (IPFS, Zeronet, LBRY, BitTorrent)


### peer 2 peer

### Beaker Browser

#### dat protocol

#### Hyperdrive

### gun.js

#### end-to-end encryption

#### Distributed Hash Tables

### Blockchain

#### What is a blockchain

### Metamask

### Interplanetary File System

#### Kubo (Golang on IPFS)



## Development cycle?

### An Agile Approach with Kanban
Using Trello, Sprints

### Test-Driven-Development
### Continuous Integration/Development
Build – We will compile the code in this stage.

Test – We will test the code in this stage. We can save both efforts as well as
time can be saved by performing the techniques of automation.

Release – In this stage, we will release the application in our GitHub repository.

Deployment – We will deploy the application to the production environment.

Validation and compliance – Your organization’s needs determine the steps to validate a build.
