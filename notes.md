# Abstract

# Introduction

## Purpose, Intended Use and Audience

Before the internet distribution of academic articles to a global audience was extremely difficult, it
required proof-reading, typesetting, printing and distribution. However since the ubiquity of the Internet
the majority of tasks performed by publishers has shrunk enormously, in fact publishers now expect
researchers to submit digital copies of their work tat require no further typesetting or processing and
as for digital distribution printing has become unnecessary. Copying is now simple and free and worldwide
distribution is instantaneous online. **(Taylor, 2012)**

The purpose of this project is to create a system for the publication of scientific articles which
can be reviewed publicly where every reviewer is in possession of a digital signature for verification.
The digital signature will be provided utilising the Metamask wallet browser extension and app, In order
to log in to the web app and to verify identity to be able to review a wallet must be used, this wallet
will cryptographically secure each users contributions and will allow for a token to be created as a
rewards system for all contributions, review, publication.
The contents of the website are distributed between all members of via IPFS a decentralised system, this
is where the website will be hosted/distributed.

According to **(Chow & Birdwell, 2022)** There is an increased distrust in scientific research in many
fields of study and the main purpose of this system is to remove the corporate structure of the
current journal publication where in many cases corporations have been found to create and promote
articles with bias towards certain priorities that suit the business opportunities of the corporation
and not the actual scientific consensus.

Originally coined by Nick Szabo "Smart Contracts" are electorinc agreements that are immutable and transparent,
deployed on a decentralised blockchain. Meaning they cannot be altered, automatically execute and everyone sees
the terms of the agreement. By utilising the trust that smart contracts provide it will enable researchers to
contribute, publish and peer-review articles removing the ability for manipulation and bias towards results,
by moving the actions of reviewers amd researchers to a proof-of-work model on a blockchain. A side benefit to
this is there will be no need for a subscription/fee based model for accessing research as the researchers
themselves will own the rights to their own work by staking them on the blockchain.

## Goals and Requirements

### Goals
"The European Universities Association (EUA) found that overall expenditure by 26 European countries was
€597 million (£515 million) in 2017. But 75% of that – some €451 million – was spent on subscriptions to
journals published by the ‘big five’: Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, Taylor & Francis and the American
Chemical Society (ACS)" **(Mehta, 2019)**.

To build a successful prototype and articulate the justification for this project to a universal
understanding as to why this needs to exist.

### Requirements

# Exploratory Analysis

The first half of this section is research and an exploration of tech,
leading to the developmental approach to be taken i.e. Agile, TDD etc.

## Decentralised
According to **(IPFS, 2022)** Decentralisation is the downloading of a file or files from many locations
that are not managed by a single organisation. The fundamental ethos behind decentralisation is the
creation of a resilient internet where for instance if a service is under attack on the current centralised
internet through a denial of service or ransomware attack the service could be disrupted, the modern
internet relies on services like Amazon Web Services(AWS) to perform quick rerouting and load-balancing in
such eventualities but again this is reliant on a single entity.

This property of having caches of content distributed globally allows for a protocol where the content
can be addressed from anywhere including remotely with little to no internet access and from a location
geographically closer to the device retrieving said content.

There have been many protocols proposed to achieve these fundamental goals.

## Comparing technologies (IPFS, Zeronet, LBRY, BitTorrent)

### peer 2 peer

### Beaker Browser

#### dat protocol

### Gun.js
Gun.js, created by Mark Nadal,

The contents of the website are distributed between all members of via  a decentralised system, this
is where the website will be hosted/distributed.

#### end-to-end encryption

#### Distributed Hash Tables

# Methodology

## Development cycle?

### Use Case Diagram

### An Agile Approach with Kanban
Using Trello, Sprints

### Test-Driven-Development
### Continuous Integration/Development
Build – We will compile the code in this stage.

Test – We will test the code in this stage. We can save both efforts as well as
time can be saved by performing the techniques of automation.

Release – In this stage, we will release the application in our GitHub repository.

Deployment – We will deploy the application to the production environment.

Validation and compliance – Your organization’s needs determine the steps to validate a build.
